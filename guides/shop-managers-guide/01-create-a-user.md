You'll need a valid email to use as your ID. Open Commerce does not enforce any password requirements but we recommend you use a strong password. The first user you create is automatically added to the *account-manager*, *system-manager*, and *owner* groups. The shop owner can assign roles to any subsequent users, but they are not added to any groups automatically.
