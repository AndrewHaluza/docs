Once you've created your first user, you're prompted to create a shop. Enter the name of the shop in the text field and click **Create Shop**. The first shop you create is automatically assigned to the primary shop type. Each Open Commerce installation can have only one *primary shop*. Any subsequent shops you may create is assigned a *merchant shop* type.

You can create multiple shops in Open Commerce. This is referred to as *multitenancy*. To create additional shops, click your shop name in the upper left corner of the screen and choose **New Shop** from the drop-down menu. Enter the name of the new shop and click **Create Shop**. This new shop is automatically assigned to the merchant shop type.
