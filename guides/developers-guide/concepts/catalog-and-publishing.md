# Catalog
 
A **catalog** is a collection of **products** that are available to a shopper on the store. A shop operator creates products in the admin system, and creates one or more variants for each product. A newly created product and variants are hidden and not published. To make the product available to a shopper, the operator has to publish the product. Only the products set to visible are published. If an operator decides to pull down a product from the store, they can set the product to hidden. This will remove the product from the store, but the operator can still view it on admin. To permanently remove a product, it can be archived.
 
Currently, each shop has a single catalog.
 
> **Note:** In the future, there may be many different catalogs per shop; for example, a spring and summer catalog, or catalogs per region. A catalog could in the future collect other things besides products, but currently only products are supported.
